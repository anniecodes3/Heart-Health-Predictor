Heart Health Predictor : 
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on a user’s health parameters. This project combines simplicity, accuracy, and explainability — making AI-based heart health prediction accessible to everyone.

Project Overview : 
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Early risk prediction is crucial 

— and this app helps you do just that using:
- Logistic Regression Model for prediction  
- Streamlit App for interactive user input  
- SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability  
- Visuals to explain which features influenced the result

Features : 
- Clean UI with health parameter inputs
- Instant prediction of heart disease risk (Yes/No)
- Dynamic SHAP plot showing feature impact
- Easy-to-run and open-source
